#**Introduction**
Given an array arr[] of size n, we will find the sum of all the perfect numbers and further we will check whether the sum is an Armstrong number or not.
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of all its proper positive divisors excluding the number itself. For e.g.: 6,28, 256, etc. 6 is a perfect number because the proper divisor of 6 are 1,2,3 (excluding 6) and sum of all its positive divisors (1+2+3) is 6.
An Armstrong number of order n is a number in which each digit when multiplied by itself n number of times and finally added together, results the same number. For eg: 371 is a three-digit number. Therefore, order=3. now, here each digit is multiplied by itself three times and finally added together and results in our original number. For e.g.:
(3*3*3+7*7*7+1*1*1) = (27+343+1) = 371

#**How to use code**
1. Type following command in git bash:
2. Git clone https://github.com/ITP-2022/assignment-folder-1.git
3. Now go to the directory where you cloned the repo
4. Go to the ass. 1 directory
5. Now run code.c


#**Test case**

**Input 1**: 
Enter number of elements:9
Enter elements---->
12
32 
6 
28 
496 
32 
54 
543
 54 

**Output 1**:
6 is a perfect number 
28 is a perfect number 
496 is a perfect number 
530 is the sum of the perfect numbers
530 is not an Armstrong Number

**Input 2**: 
Enter number of elements:4
Enter elements----> 
12
34
56 
76

**Output 2**: 
There is no perfect number.
