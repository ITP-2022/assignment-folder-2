## **Problem Statment:**
A record contains name of farmer, his age, number of acres of land that he has cultivated and the average crop that he has produced in each crop. Create an array of structure to hold records of 15 such farmers and then write a program to read these records and arrange them in ascending order by average of crops. Use the qsort( ) standard library function and collect 
crop data per each acre.

## **Introduction**<br />
Given a record which contains name of
 farmer, age, number of acres of land and
 the average crop produced.We have to 
 create an array of structure which 
 contains the record of some farmers and
 sort the data by average of crops.
 The concept of qsort and pointers will 
 make our task easier. Also the concept
 of array of structures is also helpful
in sense of storing all the records.
 An array of structures is a collection
 of different datatype variables, grouped 
 together under a single name.
 A pointer is a variable whose value is 
 the address of another variable, i.e. 
 direct address of the memory location.
 qsort is a C library function that uses
 a quick sort algorithm to sort an array.
## **How to use code**
1. Type following command in git bash:
2. Git clone https://github.com/ITP-2022/assignment-folder-2.git
3. Now go to the directory where you cloned the repo
4. Go to the Assignment-2 directory
5. Now run code.c
